# fence
I'm IT admin and I have always wanted to code.
I know a little several languages, like PHP, JavaScript, Java and SQL 
but I want to program in C++ because I am an electronics engineer.

Math solution
area = -2*a^a + fencelenght*a
d(area)/da = -4a + fencelenght

for d(area)/da = 0 we have
bestA = ceil(fencelength/4)
bestB = fenceLength - 2 * bestA;
